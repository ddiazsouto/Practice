Overview on Data Structures:
    
Data structures are like an extension on variables,
they are essentially spaces in memory which behaviour is a bit more complex (and more useful) 
than just a single idle value, the main ones are:
    
    - List
    - Dictionary
    - Sets
    - Tuples
    
    
All of them have their ups and downs 
and its assessment can be a bit comples but try to play with them
(you can also research big-O notation)
